* Description
Exploitation begins at the intersection of two core ideas: corruption program memory and gaining
control-flow. =Memory corruption= provides the foothold, allowing control over a program's execution
by overwriting critical data such as return addresses or other valuable pointers. =Shellcode= provides
the payload, a carefullly crafted sequence of instructions designed to carry out specific actions
once execution is redirected. When combined, these concepts illustrate the foundation of =software
exploitation=: not just crashing a program, but deliberately shaping its behavior to execute
attacker-controlled code.
