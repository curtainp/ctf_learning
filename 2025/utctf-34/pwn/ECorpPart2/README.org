* Description

Last year, your intership of E-Corp(Evil Corp) ended with a working router RCE exploit. Leadership
was very impressed. As a result. we chose to extend a return offer. We used your exploit to get a
MITM position on routers around the world. Now, we want to be able to use that MITM postion to
exploit browsers to further our world domaination plans! This summer, you will need to exploit
Chrome!

One of our vulnerability researchers has discovered a new type confusion bug in Chrome. It turns
out. a type confusion can be evoked by calling ~.confuse()~ on a =PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS= or
=PACKED_ELEMNTS= array. The attached =poc.js= illustrates on example. You can run it with ~./d8 ./poc.js~.
Once you have an RCE exploit, you will find a file with the flag in the current directory. Good luck
and have fun!
