* Description

The image size is 500x500. You might want to remove some stuff... Note: Some may call it guessy!
* Solution

After ~unzip~ the challenge file, we get a *coordinates.txt* file which hint us this is a coordinates.

#+begin_src shell
ctf ❯ cat dist/coordinates.txt | wc -l
250573
#+end_src

According to the description says that the image size is 500x500, but here we have more that 250000
pixel coordinates. *There are 573 pixel coordinates noise!*

#+begin_src shell
ctf ❯ sort dist/coordinates.txt | uniq -c | wc -l
250000
#+end_src

Yeah, that's right. And we can see that the noise coordinates are just duplicate of the other.

#+begin_src shell
ctf ❯ sort dist/coordinates.txt | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 15
      2 (97, 52)
      2 (97, 57)
      2 (97, 58)
      2 (97, 59)
      2 (98, 52)
      2 (98, 54)
      2 (98, 55)
      2 (98, 56)
      2 (98, 57)
      2 (98, 58)
      2 (99, 52)
      2 (99, 53)
      2 (99, 54)
      2 (99, 55)
      2 (99, 56)
#+end_src

After draw this point out, we can notice that only the point appear once can make sense.

1. parse the coordinates, then filter out the duplication noise from it.
2. draw that pixel coordinates onto the 500x500 canvas.
