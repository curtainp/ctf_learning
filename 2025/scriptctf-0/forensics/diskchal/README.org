* Solution

In =FAT32=, when a file is delete, its directory entry remains in the root directory, but the first
byte is overwritten, usually with =0xE5=, and marked as free. If the file haven't been overwritten,
its easy to recover.

#+begin_src shell
  icat -f fat32 xxx.img [inode]   # icat from sleuthkit
#+end_src
