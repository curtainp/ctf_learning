* Description

Elowen has been cursed to roam forever in an inescapable maze. You need to break her curse and set
her free.

* Solution

First we run the program, we're given a TUI application showing something like a maze.

Notice that top left corner contains the dimensions of the current terminal, and that information
will update when we resize the terminal. Keep this in mind, may be helpful with next analysis.

Load it into IDA, the ~main~ function and description has hinted us that use =Ncurses= to draw the
character maze. Then we want to find the logic for dimensions information:

We can notice that there are judgement for current terminal dimension (13, 37). when that satisfied,
the programs use ~waddch~ to draw some character. So, let's resize the terminal to that size. Oh,
that's flag is!

BTW, what make me to try this first is that ~waddch~ xref a chunk data in =.data= segment.
