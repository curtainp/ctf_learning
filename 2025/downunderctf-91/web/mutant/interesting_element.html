<!-- one of the interesting elements is the `from`. It's quite special element in the HTML -->
<!-- bacause it cannot be nested in itself. the specification is explicit that it cannot have -->
<!-- any descendants that is also a `from` element. -->
<!-- this will yield the following DOM tree: -->
<!-- <form id='from1'> -->
<!-- inside form1 inside form2 -->

<form id=form1>
inside form1
<form id=form2>
inside form2


<!-- it's possible to create nested forms with a slightly broken markup with mis-nested tags -->
<!-- <form id='outer'><div><form id='inner'><input> -->
<form id='outer'><div></form><form id='inner'><input>
<!-- this is not a bug in any particular browser; it results directly from the HTML spec, and described -->
<!-- in the algorithm of parsing HTML: -->
<!-- - when we open a `<form>` tag, the parse needs to keep record of the fact that it was opened with a form -->
  <!-- element pointer, if the pointer is not null, then form element cannot be created. -->
<!-- - when we end a `<form>` tag, the form element pointer is always set to null. -->
