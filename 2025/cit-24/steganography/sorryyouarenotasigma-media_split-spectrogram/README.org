The lion says solve this challenge. You seem to have a good track record at doing so.

* Solution

We get a =mp4= media file, let's use =ffmpeg= to parse it.

#+begin_src bash
Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'lion.mp4':
  Metadata:

#+end_src

We can see there're 2 =audio stream= within this file, let's extract it out. Then, I load it into
=Audacity=, with the =spectrogram view= I discover this interesting payload, the other audio don't has
useful information.

After the execute this payload, we get flag:

#+begin_src bash
