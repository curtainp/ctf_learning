* Description 

Moto Moto likes you. But not enough to explain how his server works. We got a pcap of the client and
server communicating. Can you figure out how the server works and retrieve the flag? 

~chals.swampctf.com:44254~

* Solution

Analyzed the =pcap= file, we can notice that there're almost the =TLS= and =UDP= traffic. the former we
can't parser without key, but the latter give me the flag like this:

[[file:2025-04-30_17-32.png]]

As the flag hints, this is not the real flag we need. but we notice that flag was send to the client
after it send some =command= like  *give me the ~flag.txt~*. the first two bytes seems like header
metadata information.  And there's a server address within description. Let's do it.

#+begin_src python :results output
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket

server = "chals.swampctf.com"
port = 44254

# 02 command request
# 08 command length
# command payload
payload = b"\x02\x08\x66\x6c\x61\x67\x2e\x74\x78\x74"

# UDP protocol
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

_ = s.sendto(payload, (server, port))

response, addr = s.recvfrom(4096)

print(f"response: {response.decode(errors='ignore')}")

s.close()
#+end_src

Yeah, we get the flag.
