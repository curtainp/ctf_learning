* Description 

We caught a threat actor, called MuddyWater, bruteforcing a login for our Domain Controller. We have
a packet capture of the intrustion. Can you figure out which account they logged in to and what the
password is? 

=Flag format is swampCTF{<username>:<password>}=

This challenge give us a =pcap= file, let's load it to wireshark. According to the /Description/ hints,
we need to figure out which account login successfully with ~SMBv2~ protocol, but this =pcap= file has
lots of useless packets within. So we need to find the filter which can help us point out the
successful login packet. After some investigation, I get the key point of ~SMBv2~ successful login that
is ~smb2.nt_status == STATUS_SUCCESS~, after apply it to wireshark, we get it.

Then we follow this stream to figure out what =username=, which is ~hackbackzip~ . And ~NTLMv2~ hash which
can extract =password= from it. And the pattern of this hash is following:

#+begin_example
[domainname]::[username]:[NTLM Server Challenge]:[NTProofStr]:[NTLMv2 Response - NTProofStr]
#+end_example

With that in mind, we can find =NTLM Server Challenge= within =Session Setup Response= message, which has
=NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE(0x00000002)= field.

The same as above one, =NTProofStr= and =NTLMv2 Response= can be found within message that has
=NTLMSSP_AUTH= field.

Conbined all of that according to the pattern above. we use ~hashcat~ to extract the login password:

#+begin_example
ctf ‚ùØ hashcat  -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt  --show

#+end_example

So password is: ~pikeplace~.
