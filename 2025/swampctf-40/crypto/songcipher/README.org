* Description

Somebody once told me the cipher was gonna roll me. You are the sharpest tool in the shed <3 After
this challenge you might want to add that song to your playlist :) 

* Solution

The challenge we get looks strange at first glance, but the title hints us that this is a
=songcipher=, So what's the song? Maybe the description? After I google for this get what I want:

[[file:2025-04-30_12-09.png]]

Now, I have the =key lyrics= and the cipher text, but what's cipher algorithm? Then I look the cipher
text again, this "number" almost close to ASCII table (which 127 max). So we can try basic operation
between them.

#+begin_src python :results output
>>> a = [0xaa, 0xd7, 0xce, 0xd9, 0x82, 0xd0]
>>> b = "Somebody"
>>> c = [ord(i) for i in b]
>>> for a, c in zip(a, c):
...     xor = a ^ c
...     dec = a - c
...     print(xor, dec)
...
249 87
184 104
163 97
188 116
224 32
191 97
#+end_src

Luckily, seems like =subtraction= make sense (the results are within the ASCII table):

#+begin_src python :results output
#!/usr/bin/env python3

with open('./data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
    
data_num = [int(d, 16) for d in data.split(',')]
lyrics = "Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead"
lyrics_num = [ord(i) for i in lyrics]

for d, l in zip(data_num, lyrics_num):
    print(chr(d - l), end = '')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
