* Solution

Code analysis reveals a critical vulnerability in ~routes.js~, the content returned by the API is passed =directly= to eval
without any verification:

#+begin_src javascript
const flag = await eval(content);
#+end_src

So, next we should consider to control what returned by the API. to do this. it's possible to force the template to return
exactly the following code:

#+begin_src javascript
require('fs').readFileSync('flag.txt', 'utf8');
#+end_src
