Welcome to Fool's Gulch, prospector! Word around the saloon is that old Jeremiah Plaid struck gold
somewhere in these hills before he disappeared. His journal entries mention a secret sequence that
leads to The Mother Lode - the richest gold vein in all the territory. Can you decipher Jeremiah's
cryptic notes and find the treasure that's eluded so many fortune seekers? Enter the correct
sequence, and you might just strike it rich! Remember, not all gold that glitters is worth the same.
The purer your find, the higher your claim will be valued at the assayer's office.

** Fool's Gulch
Old Man Jenkins' map to his modest gold claim has been floating around Fool's Gulch for years. Most think
it's worthless, but you've noticed something peculiar in the worn-out corners...


** The Mother Lode
The legendary Jeremiah Plaid's final journal has emerged after 50 years! It contains cryptic coordinates
to what he called "The Mother Lode" - a gold vein so pure and vast it would make the richest man in
California look like a pauper. But the old prospector was paranoid and encoded his secret...
